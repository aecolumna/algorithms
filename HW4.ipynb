    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "CSE 331 professor Sebnem Onsay taught us that insertionSort was more efficient than mergesort for $n < 10$, \n",
    "and for any range of data that was nearly sorted. The CLRS textbook echoes this. This makes sense, as mergesort performs the same number of operations\n",
    "regardless of how partially sorted the array were sorting is, whereas a factor in the time required by insertionsort is the distance an element is from is final destination. So the best case for insertion sort is $O(n)$ when were sorting an already sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this, we imagine the $n < 10$ holds for the most efficient implementation of mergesort, which is harder to code (Our version of insertionsort can't be improved in python at least). The simpler implementation of mergesort we're planning on using obviously still has the same asymptotic complexity as any other version of mergesort, but adds some gnarly linear terms that might show up for small n. This is due to copying of lists (e.g. mergesort(arr[:mid]) instead of just passing parameters i and mid and mid and j when splitting the left half and right half of the arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our guess is that insertionsort will be more efficient than mergesort for $n < 50$. Mergesort will be more efficient for all $n > 50$."

Then we sum how long it takes each algorithm to sort the ten random arrays, and we divide it by ten to find the mean. To be clear, both algorithms sort the same permutation of a random array. The integer sizes used in the random arrays range from 1 to 1000."
